# Project Prime

This is an FPS game project made in Unreal Engine 4.


## High Concept
A throwback to old-school action shooters. Find weapons, fight monsters, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets as you traverse through a diverse world. Try to stay alive and escape from the planet.

Traverse levels in linear order, defeating monster, solving puzzles, gradually finding new weapons and items, encounter and defeat bosses, and finish the game all while following a coherent narrative.
